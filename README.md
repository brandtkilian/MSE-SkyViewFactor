# MSE-SkyViewFactor

Project that consist of computing the Skyviewfactor (SVF) from hemispheric images using image processing technics and CNN segnet.

The Segnet architecture used in this project is inspired by the work of [pradyu1993](https://github.com/pradyu1993/segnet) that made a Keras implementation of the SegNet proposed in a paper from the Cambridge University that you can find [there](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561v2.pdf)
