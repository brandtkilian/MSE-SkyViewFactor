# MSE-SkyViewFactor

Project that consists of computing the Skyviewfactor (SVF) from hemispheric images (taken by an embeded camera in a backpack while walking) using image processing technics and a CNN SegNet.

## Image processing technics

Coming soon

## SegNet

The Segnet architecture used in this project is inspired by the work of [pradyu1993](https://github.com/pradyu1993/segnet) that made a Keras implementation of the SegNet proposed in a paper from the Cambridge University that you can find [there](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561v2.pdf).
